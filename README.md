## Navbar
The Navbar.jsx component is a simple navigation bar that contains the project logo. By clicking on the logo, users can easily navigate back to the home page.

## HomePage
The HomePage.jsx component serves as the initial landing page for the Interview Assessment System. It presents users with a form containing a dropdown list of courses to choose from. Depending on the selected course, relevant checkboxes are displayed to allow users to choose additional options. If the user selects the "OTHER INFO" option, they can input custom text. After selecting the course and options, users can click the "Start Interview" button to proceed to the interview page.

## Interview
The Interview.jsx component is responsible for conducting the interview. It fetches interview questions from GPT-3.5 API and utilizes the react-speech-recognition library to enable speech recognition functionality. This enables users to provide verbal responses to the interview questions, and their answers are saved in the local state. Once users have answered all the questions, both their responses and the questions are sent to the GPT-3.5 API to generate feedback.

## VideoComp
The VideoComp.jsx component grants access to the user's media stream, which is then used to display their video using the navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia method. The component renders the user's video, enhancing the interactive nature of the assessment process.

## Question
The Question.jsx component receives feedback data as props and displays the feedback questions along with the user's responses in a table format. This allows users to review their interview performance and the generated feedback.

### ChartPage
The ChartPage.jsx component displays a pie chart representing feedback scores. It fetches the feedback data from local storage and uses React Chart.js library to display the data in a pie chart. The feedback data is converted from an object to an array using the useState and useEffect hooks. The chart displays scores for "Conceptual Understanding," "Communication Skill," "Accuracy," and "Clarity." It also shows a table with the same scores.
